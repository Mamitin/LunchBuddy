### Welcome to LunchBuddy
#### Have a try of our app: https://mysterious-dusk-16372.herokuapp.com/
#### Why LunchBuddy?
##### The idea behind this application is to encourage people within the same company to go out and have lunch together. This can pose as a team-building construct for the company as a whole.

#### User Stories: ideas that we want
##### For this application, we want the user to be able to sign-up/ login and then create and/or join a group for lunch.
##### Once the group is created, we want other users to be able to click on that group and be able to join. The group will be created via a card and on that card and it will show what kind of food that group is going to go for for lunch.

### Backend Side:
### Models we have:
##### lunchesschema: we have lunchname, restaurant name, host person's name, lunchtype, lunch time, image about the restaurant and the restaurant link:
